    name: "Simple What If",

    objective: "Answer a 'what if' question creatively. The AI will provide a logical analysis. See how human creativity compares to AI reasoning!",
    question: "What if humans could fly?",
    aiResponse: "If humans could fly, several physiological changes would be required. Humans would need lighter bones, stronger chest muscles, and a different respiratory system to support flight. From a physics perspective, humans would need wings with approximately a 7-meter wingspan to generate enough lift. Society would be completely transformed with new transportation systems, building designs, and laws regarding airspace. Energy expenditure for flight would be significant, requiring humans to consume more calories daily."

    name: "Complex What If",
    description: "Explore a complex hypothetical scenario",
    objective: "Answer a complex 'what if' question that involves multiple systems. The AI will analyze the interconnected impacts. Compare human intuition with systematic analysis!",
    question: "What if the internet suddenly disappeared worldwide?",
    aiResponse: "The sudden disappearance of the internet would cause immediate global disruption. Financial markets would crash, communication systems would fail, and supply chains would break down. Emergency services would be severely impacted. Within days, governments would struggle to function, and access to information would be limited to physical media. Long-term effects include economic depression, social isolation, and a complete restructuring of how societies function. Recovery would take years, with new systems emerging that are less dependent on centralized networks."

  {
    name: "Future What If",
    description: "Explore a futuristic hypothetical scenario",
    objective: "Answer a futuristic 'what if' question. The AI will extrapolate based on current trends. See how human imagination compares to AI projections!",
    question: "What if we discovered we're living in a simulation?",
    aiResponse: "The discovery that we're living in a simulation would fundamentally challenge our understanding of reality. Scientific paradigms would shift dramatically as researchers would need to consider the simulation's parameters and creators. Philosophical and religious systems would face existential questions about purpose and free will. Economies might collapse if people perceived their efforts as meaningless. However, it could also lead to new technologies as we attempt to understand and potentially manipulate the simulation's code. The psychological impact would vary, with some experiencing existential dread while others find liberation from previous constraints."
